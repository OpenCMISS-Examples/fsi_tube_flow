Template OpenCMISS example - python
======================================

This example shows the how a python script can used to create an example.  For more detailed information refer to the `master <https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/template_example/tree/master>`_ branch.

CMake files
===========

CMake plays no part in getting a Python script running, so we don't need any CMake files at all for a Python only example.

Remember
========

Replace this file with a description about your example.
